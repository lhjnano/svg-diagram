  // example in SKILL.md:103 is a long name like `Employee instances`; written inside a narrow
  // dashed grouping box, its right edge overflows, and requiring full containment would miss it — which
  // is exactly what this step is meant to prevent. The same `pointInBBox(t.center, ...)`
  // already used for text-to-box binding is reused here so both places cannot drift apart.
  // groupRects is used rather than filtering dashed again: filtering again would bring in the
  // background rectangle, and in a diagram with a dashed full-diagram outer frame the real
  // title would be classified as a group name and excluded (doc.title = null), silently
  // disabling the entire title-centred check.
