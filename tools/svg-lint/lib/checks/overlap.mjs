// that line very wide, so it is truncated by display columns (see MAX_COLUMNS); ③ JSON.stringify

// `\"` so the reader can tell where the label boundary is — the cost is that backslashes are

//
// The budget is in **display columns**, not character count: East Asian wide characters and
// emoji each occupy two columns in a terminal, so 40 Chinese characters is 80 columns; with
// a line/column prefix and a `[check/code]` suffix the whole line reaches about 150 columns

// Width N and occupies only one. The whole range is counted as 2 because over-counting only
// causes truncation one column sooner, whereas under-counting causes a line to wrap — and
// not wrapping is the whole point of this budget. This is not a complete East Asian Width
// table; it only covers the ranges that appear in diagrams.
// No astral ranges here, and adding them would change no answer: ① below already gives any

//      backslash gives 2, and a character JSON escapes to the `\uXXXX` form — a lone surrogate, or a
//      control character with no short escape such as U+0001 — gives 6. Code units, not printed
//      cells: an astral character that escapes to itself gives 2 for one cell (U+1D400 measured);
//   ② 2 for a character that falls in WIDE.
// The larger, rather than one or the other: `中` escapes to a single code unit but draws two columns,
// so ② speaks for it, while a quote is outside WIDE but escapes to two code units, so ① speaks.

// themselves, so ① gives them 1 column (U+FE0F, U+200B and U+00AD measured; U+3164 lands in WIDE and
