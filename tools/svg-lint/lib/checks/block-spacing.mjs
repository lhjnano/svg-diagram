// "Nearest neighbour" is not enough: in a three-row diagram, if a column skips the middle
// row, the gap between the top and bottom boxes in that column can be over 90px, yet they
// are separated by another row's boxes — they are not neighbours. gapOf requires horizontal
// overlap for the vertical direction, so the middle box never enters the candidates;
// nearestAfter alone cannot block this case. Without this step, every staggered-layout
// diagram would receive a spacing-too-loose finding.
//
// **The exemption applies to the vertical direction only** (decided 2026-08-30). A "row" is
// a layout unit: measuring the gap across an entire row does not measure adjacency; two boxes
// in the same row are adjacent, and a box in another row (most typically the centred parent
// in a fan-out diagram) does not change that. Exempting both axes would silently miss all
// over-wide gaps between the two children in an up-down fan-out layout; keeping only the
// vertical side means a diagram that intentionally leaves a horizontal gap in the same row
// receives a false positive — and SKILL.md has no such layout.
//
// This trade-off **has a cost on both sides** — do not read the retained side as safe: the
// two shapes are geometric mirrors of each other, and at three-box scale no criterion can
// distinguish them. Keeping the vertical exemption therefore means accepting its mirror's
// false negative — in a left-right fan-out (parent on the left, two children stacked
// vertically on the right, parent's y interval falling between the two children), the
// over-wide vertical gap between the children cannot be reported. The test labelled
// `a left-right fan-out is a known blind spot` pins this behaviour; it will surface if this
// code is changed. The reason to keep this side is this tool's own trade-off and not a rule from
// SKILL.md: the shape the exemption protects — a column that skips a row, which any staggered
// layout produces — is judged more common than the left-right fan-out it blinds the tool to, and a
// false positive costs more than a false negative here, because the acceptance bar is zero warnings,
// so a false positive blocks a correct diagram while a false negative only fails to help. SKILL.md's
// Box layout section (lines 97–99) holds the only rules it states about rows and columns — boxes in
// one row differ in size by ≤60px, boxes in one column share a centre line, and an outer box encloses
// its inner boxes with equal padding. It mentions a row or a column three times more (lines 377, 542
// and 582): a reminder to update the rest of a row when one box moves, the checklist restating the
// ≤60px rule, and the same reminder in the rework list. None of the six speaks to a column that
// skips a row, so nothing there settles which side to keep.
// The `axis === 'Vertical' &&` at the call site is behaviourally redundant: the function
// below only uses y coordinates, and for a horizontal pair `hi` (right box top) is less than
// `lo` (left box bottom) or unrelated, so the condition is never true. It is kept because
// "this exemption covers vertical only" is a decision that should be visible at the call
// site, not something the reader has to infer from the function body.
