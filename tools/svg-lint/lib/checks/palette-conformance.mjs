// names is the `color` property, which this model does not carry. Judging it means resolving something not
// recorded, and calling it a colour name would tell the author to write the hex of a keyword that has none.
// `inherit` is deliberately absent: the cascade resolves it during collect (see inheritedPaint), so what
